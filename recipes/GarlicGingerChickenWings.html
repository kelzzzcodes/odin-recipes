    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My mom lives in a small town in western New York, called Clifton Springs.
      Whenever I go home to visit, I usually indulge in some Buffalo chicken
      wings from a place called Emerson's.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have two flavors of wings; Buffalo-style, and sweet and sour. I came
      up with what turned out to be a deliciously sticky, ginger and garlic
      glaze. I really hope you give these a try.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with
        aluminum foil; grease the foil with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken in a large mixing bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and
        hot sauce. Add the vegetable oil; toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the flour and wings in a large, food-safe plastic bag. Hold the
        bag closed tightly, and shake to coat the wings entirely with the flour;
        no wet spots should remain. Arrange the wings on the prepared baking
        sheets, making sure none of the pieces are touching one another. Spray
        wings with additional cooking spray
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turn all the wings, and
        return to the oven to cook until crispy and no longer pink in the
        center, about 30 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the garlic, ginger, chili paste, rice vinegar, brown
        sugar, and soy sauce in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and
        immediately remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put about half the wings in a large mixing bowl. Pour about half the
        sauce over the wings. Toss the wings with tongs to coat evenly; transfer
        to a tray and allow to sit about 5 minutes to allow the sauce to soak
        into the wings before serving. Repeat with remaining wings and sauce.
